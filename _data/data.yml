    title: Profile
    summary: |
      My current role as a Research Computing Facilitator at Rochester Institute of Technology enables me to combine my passion for software engineering, security, research, and teaching to assist multi-disciplinary researchers in their quest to discover. Outside of work, I relax by reading (mostly non-fiction), building Lego (sets and custom designs), brewing beer (I'm not good at it yet), and studying the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

          **Advisor:** [Dr. Andrew Meneely](https://www.se.rit.edu/~andy/)

          **Committee:** Dr. Daniel Krutz, Dr. Mehdi Mirakhorli, Dr. Emily Prud'hommeaux

          **Dissertation Title:** [Human Error Assessment in Software Engineering](https://repository.rit.edu/theses/11609/)

          **Dissertation Abstract:** Software engineers work under strict constraints, balancing a complex, multi-phase development process on top of user support and professional development. Despite their best efforts, software engineers experience human errors, which manifest as software defects. While some defects are simple bugs, others can be costly security vulnerabilities. Practices such as defect tracking and vulnerability disclosure help software engineers reflect on the outcomes of their human errors (*i.e.* software failures), and even the faults that led to those failures, but not the underlying human behaviors. While human error theory from psychology research has been studied and applied to medical, industrial, and aviation accidents, researchers are only beginning to systematically reflect on software engineers' human errors. Some software engineering research has used human error theories from psychology to help developers identify and organize their human errors (mistakes) during requirements engineering activities, but developers need an improved and systematic way to reflect on their human errors during other phases of software development. The goal of this dissertation is **to help software engineers confront and reflect on their human errors by creating a process to document, organize, and analyze human errors.** To that end, our research comprises three phases: (1) systematization (*i.e.* identification and taxonomization) of software engineers' human errors from literature and development artifacts into a Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.), (2) evaluation and refinement of T.H.E.S.E. based on software engineers' perceptions and natural language insights, and (3) creation of a human error informed micro post-mortem process and the Human Error Reflection Engine (H.E.R.E.), a proof-of-concept GitHub workflow facilitating human error reflection. In demonstrating the utility of T.H.E.S.E. and our micro post-mortem process, the software development community will be closer to inculcating the wisdom of historical developer human errors, enabling them to engineer higher quality and more secure software.

          **Dissertation Artifacts:**

            - **Data:**
              - **[88.6 Million Developer Comments from GitHub](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10080449)** -- A collection of software developer comments from GitHub issues, commits, and pull requests. We collected 88,640,237 developer comments from 17,378 repositories. In total, this dataset includes: 54,252,380 issue comments (from 13,458,208 issues), 979,642 commit comments (from 49,710,108 commits), and 33,408,215 pull request comments (from 12,680,373 pull requests).
              - **[1,237 Annotated Developer Apologies from GitHub](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10079441)** -- A collection of software developer comments from GitHub with automated apology annotations. This dataset also includes manual apology classifications from two annotators and resolutions for their disagreements.
              - **[200 Annotated Developer Human Errors from GitHub](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10080449)** -- A collection of software developer comments from GitHub with manual human error categorizations.
              - **[162 Human Errors Descriptions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10079277)** -- A collection of human error descriptions with T.H.E.S.E. categorizations and related discussion collected during our user study with software engineering students.
              - **Systematic Literature Review of Human Errors in Software Engineering** -- A systematic literature review of 68 research studies (identified from 284 total papers) which yielded 192 total human errors in software engineering.
            - **Tools:**
              - **Automated Apology Classifier** -- A na&iuml;ve keyword-based approach to automatically classifying apologies in natural language. This approach accounts for false-positives and yields near perfect recall (99%) and high F1 (87%).
              - **Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.)** -- A taxonomy of 31 categories of human error in software engineering spanning slips, lapses, and mistakes.
              - **Human Error Informated Micro Post-Mortem Process** -- A human error reflection process that we designed to accompany T.H.E.S.E. This process makes it easy for software engineers to confront and reflect on their human errors.
              - **[Human Error Reflection Engine (H.E.R.E.)](https://github.com/meyersbs/these-poc)** -- A semi-automated workflow that facilitates our human error informed micro post-mortem process on GitHub. This workflow serves as a proof-of-concept while also lowering the barrier to entry for software engineering teams who wish to adopt human error reflection with T.H.E.S.E.
            - **Code:**
              - **[Downloading Developer Comments &amp; Apology Classification](https://github.com/meyersbs/developer-apologies/)** -- Code used to collect software developer comments from GitHub and classify their apologies.
              - **[Evaluating Sentence-BERT Models for Human Error Classification](https://github.com/meyersbs/sbert-these)** -- Jupyter notebooks used to evaluate pretrained Sentence-BERT models for human error classification.
